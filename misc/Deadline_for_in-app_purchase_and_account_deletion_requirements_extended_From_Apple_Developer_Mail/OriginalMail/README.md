## 原文

Hello Contact,

In order to provide more time to update your apps, we’ve changed the following requirement deadlines to June 30, 2022.

Online group event in-app purchases
In 2020, we chose to support apps and developers that needed to adapt services from in-person to digital as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Specifically, we deferred App Store Review [Guideline 3.1.1][App Store Review Guidelines - Apple Developer - 3.1.1], which requires apps offering paid online group services to do so via in-app purchase.

Given the recent resurgence of COVID and its continued impact on in-person services, we’ve extended the most recent deadline to June 30, 2022.

As a reminder, [guideline 3.1.3(d)][App Store Review Guidelines - Apple Developer - 3.1.3(d)] allows apps offering realtime person-to-person services between two individuals (for example, tutoring students, medical consultations, real estate tours, or fitness training) to use purchase methods other than in-app purchase.

Account deletion within apps
App Store Review [Guideline 5.1.1][App Store Review Guidelines - Apple Developer - 5.1.1] provides people with greater control over their personal data by stating that all apps that allow for account creation must also allow users to initiate deletion of their account from within the app. This requirement was set to apply to all app submissions by January 31, 2022. Due to the complexity of implementing this requirement, we’ve extended the deadline to June 30, 2022 to give you more time.

Please keep these requirements in mind when updating your app:

The account deletion option should be easy to find in your app.
It’s insufficient to only provide the ability to temporarily disable or deactivate an account. People should be able to delete the account along with their personal data.
Apps in highly-regulated industries may need to provide additional support flows to confirm and facilitate the account deletion process.
Follow applicable legal requirements for storing and retaining user account information. This includes complying with local laws in different countries or regions. As always, check with your legal counsel.

Best regards,
